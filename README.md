# Do it ! App

I made this web app to list things that need to be done, i want to made my own "to do app" that i can use and save own local storage.<br/>
With this "to do app", you can add, edit and delete the things that has been listed.<br/>

I made this web app using React.js to learn about useState and useEffect
